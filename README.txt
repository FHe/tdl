The xray Data analysis Library (Tdl) is a python based project that assembles a number of data analysis routines into a single package. Tdl includes methods for analyzing synchrotron xray data, performing a variety of crystallography computations, and modeling diffraction and spectroscopy, among other tasks.  This project is still in a very early stage of development.
