- Proposal for layout.  Continue with the idea of 2 different layouts

1. development and standalone (essentially as is):
TDL_DIR/tdl                            # startup script
TDL_DIR/lib/...                        # contains core library and standard modules
TDL_DIR/modules/...                    # contains addon/optional modules
TDL_DIR/modules/startup.tdl            # startup tdl commands
TDL_DIR/examples/...                   # examples
TDL_DIR/tests/...                      # tests 

1. site packages (installed via TDL_DIR//setup.py):
~python/bin/tdl                                        # startup script
~python/.../site-packages/tdl/...                      # contains core library and standard modules
~python/.../site-packages/tdl_modules/...              # contains addon/optional modules
~python/.../site-packages/tdl_modules/startup.tdl      # startup tdl commands


The users 'path' should include the directory with the tdl script and python executable for either case.

The tdl script should identify each case. The folowing should be added to python path:
.                                      # current working directory
~tdl/                                  # core library directory 
                                       # (will be on pythonpath already if its in site-packages)
                                       # otherwise add TDL_DIR/lib
~modules                               # or ~tdl_modules
~modules/*                             # all directories under ~modules (or ~tdl_modules)
  

It should also find the file ~modules/startup.tdl and pass that to get executed on startup.  

Finally it should find if there is a 'HOME' or 'TDL_HOME' environment variable, and pass
HOME/startup.tdl for execution as well if it exists (ie user specific options).

- Moved around layout and setup.py / distutils.  The main executable script
  is now just 'tdl' and gets installed on Unix systems.

- Changed string handling so that 'single quote' strings have literal \*
  escape sequences, and "double quote" strings have interpreted \* escape
  sequences.  
  tdl> print 'a\nb'
  a\nb
  tdl> print "a\nb"
  a
  b

- Added (and played much with) simple plotting with TkPlotter 
  over the past couple days.  The plot and newplot functions added, with 
  key/val args for color, style, etc.  In addition, the _plot namespace
  is used for interacting with the plotter:
    _plot.cursor_x, _plot.cursor_y    cursor values
    _plot.xlabel, _plot.ylabel, _plot.title   x-, y-labels, title.

- In order for a fcn__cmdout to recieve additional keyword arguments, 
two small changes are needed: 1) in Expression.py the call to __cmdout__
needs to pass **kws, and the function it self must have **kws defined.  
Is there a better way to do that (see the ls example).

- Unfortunatley still get funky output for path like strings on windows...
