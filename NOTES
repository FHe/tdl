- Moved around layout and setup.py / distutils.  The main executable script
  is now just 'tdl' and gets installed on Unix systems.

- Changed string handling so that 'single quote' strings have literal \*
  escape sequences, and "double quote" strings have interpreted \* escape
  sequences.  
  tdl> print 'a\nb'
  a\nb
  tdl> print "a\nb"
  a
  b

- Added (and played much with) simple plotting with TkPlotter 
  over the past couple days.  The plot and newplot functions added, with 
  key/val args for color, style, etc.  In addition, the _plot namespace
  is used for interacting with the plotter:
    _plot.cursor_x, _plot.cursor_y    cursor values
    _plot.xlabel, _plot.ylabel, _plot.title   x-, y-labels, title.

- In order for a fcn__cmdout to recieve additional keyword arguments, 
two small changes are needed: 1) in Expression.py the call to __cmdout__
needs to pass **kws, and the function it self must have **kws defined.  
Is there a better way to do that (see the ls example).

- Unfortunatley still get funky output for path like strings on windows...
